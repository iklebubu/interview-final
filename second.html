            <sup>rick</sup> What were the inspirations along the way for
            you—musically, lyrically, or philosophically—that got you to this
            stage? <br />
            <br />
            <sup>kendrick</sup> Oh, man. First off would have to be how I was
            raised. The environment. My father being a complete realist, just in
            the streets. And my mother being a dreamer. It starts there first,
            before I even heard any type of melody or lyric. That's just DNA.
            It's always the yin and the yang, the good versus the evil. And that
            pushed me toward the music that I love to listen to. You know,
            Tupac, Biggie, Jay. Your usual suspects. These were the people that
            was played in my household.

        <div class="qa" id="music">
          <p>
            <sup>rick</sup> Was the music playing in your house your choice of
            music, or was it the music your parents were listening to? <br />
            <br />
            <sup>kendrick</sup> Definitely my parents. My parents were fairly
            young in the city of Compton. So the things that they played—you
            know, that was the hip crowd. So I was being exposed to all these
            ideas, from Big Daddy Kane to Eazy-E to the Bay Area—Too Short,
            E-40—you know, back to Marvin Gaye and the Isley Brothers. This
            field of music just broadened my ideas to come. We never would've
            thought in a million years that I'd be doing it.

            <sup>rick</sup> When did jazz find its way into your world? <br />
            <br />
            <sup>kendrick</sup> It's a trip, because I was in the studio one
            day, and my guy Terrace Martin noticed something about the type of
            sounds that I was picking. He was like, Man, a lot of the chords
            that you pick are jazz-influenced. You don't understand: You a jazz
            musician by default. And that just opened me up. And he just started
            breaking down everything, the science, going back to Miles, Herbie
            Hancock.

        <div class="qa" id="audience">
          <p>
            <sup>rick</sup> When making music, do you ever consider the audience
            at all, or is it more just self-expression? <br />
            <br />
            <sup>kendrick</sup> I used to consider the listener. But now I'm in
            a space where if I'm not inspired, I can't really do the music. I
            can't feel it. I put in enough hours to be able to pen a hundred-bar
            verse on the spot at any given moment. But for me to actually feel
            an idea, it has to come from me. And a lot of times, I have to block
            out different needs and wants just for my own selfish reasons. But
            at the end of the day, it comes out where, whether you like it or
            not, you know it comes from a real place. It's gonna feel
            unapologetic, uncompromising, and it's gonna feel me.

        <div class="qa" id="unapologetic">
          <p>
            <sup>rick</sup> When you say unapologetic, has there ever been
            anything that comes up that you feel like, I don't want to say that
            on a record? <br />
            <br />
            <sup>kendrick</sup> That's a great question. I always said to
            myself, if I said it on a record, I never retract my statements.
            Because it's my self-expression, and you can have your opinions on
            it, you can feel a certain type of way, but it's how I feel. And I
            can't contradict that at all.

            <br />
            <sup>kendrick</sup> Yeah, I think I got the confidence for it. If I
            can master the idea and make the time to approach it the right way,
            I think I can push it out.

            <sup>rick</sup> In one of your lyrics, you mention meditation. Do
            you have a meditation practice? <br />
            <br />
            <sup>kendrick</sup> Yeah, man. I have to have at least 30 minutes to
            myself. If it's not on the daily, every other day, to just sit back,
            close my eyes, and absorb what's going on. You know, the space that
            I'm in. When you in music—and everybody knows this—the years are
            always cut in half, because you always have something to do. We in
            the studio for four months, that go by. Now you gotta go on the road
            for five months, that go by. Next thing you know, five years going
            by and you 29 years old. You know? So I have to find a way to
            understand the space that I'm in and how I'm feeling at the moment.
            'Cause if I don't, it's gonna zoom. I know. I feel it. And I'm sure
            you know what I'm talking about. It just goes and then you miss out
            on your moment because you're so in the moment you didn't know the
            moment was going on, if that makes sense.
